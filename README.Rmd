# About

The R package `vrmvrm` (pronouced "vroom-vroom") is a tidyverse-style toolset for working with spatial data. Unlike most packages working with spatial data in R, we have focused on small-scale data rather than geographic data. This is because the package creator has a background in behavioral data collected virtual and augmented reality studies.

# Quick View

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(vrmvrm)
```

```{R}
spiral <- tibble(i = seq(0, 10*pi, 0.05)) %>%
  mutate(
    # vector3s are created using three numeric vector arguments,
    # and thanks to dplyr, can refer to other columns in the dataframe
    circular_part = vector3(x=cos(i), y=sin(i), z=0),
    forward_part = vector3(x=0, y=0, z=i/15),
    # vector3s can be added together and multiplied by numerics
    spiral_part = circular_part * i / 30 + forward_part
  )

spiral %>% head(10)

spiral %>%
  # field access uses the $ operator
  ggplot(aes(x=spiral_part$x, y=spiral_part$y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_path() +
  coord_equal()
```

# Contributions

Contributions are welcome! The interest is not sufficiently large to be a bandwidth issue for me, so the issue tracker can be used for bug reports, feature requests, and questions - whatever you might need.
