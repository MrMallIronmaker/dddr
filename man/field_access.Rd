\usage{
\method{$}{dddr_quat}(x, name)

\method{$}{dddr_vector3}(x, name)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Vector3 whose fields to access}

\item{name}{Field name to access. For vectors, this should be one of "x",
"y", or "z". For quaternions, this can include "w" as well.}
}
\description{
In order to access fields within each vector, the `$` operator is used.
}
\examples{
vector3(x=1:4, y=2:5, z=3:6)$y
