\title{Create a quaternion}
\usage{
quat(w, x, y, z)
}
\arguments{
\item{w, x, y, z}{Numeric vectors of the quaternion values. It is rare to need
to access these fields.}
}
\description{
Creates a quaternion, a four-dimensional number that represents 3D rotation
well. The values underneath the quaternions are not interpretable for the
naive user; however, one can learn how to read these values. See the vignette
[TODO: link vignette] for an explanation.
